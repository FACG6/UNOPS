# GIT WORKFLOW

## Before starting work
* Search this repo's issues to see if an issue exists for the problem you are solving.
* If the issue does not exist, create it.
* If your new issue relates to any others, reference those issues in the body. This enables others to follow the history of the topic.
* Once you are sure of what you need to do and that it is needed, assign yourself to the issue.
* Create a new branch for your work.

## Commits
* We should keep the commits as small and descriptive as possible.
* Make sure that you reference the issue in each commit you write. This is important for tracking progress and resolving any issues/bugs that we might discover later on.
* When you make your first commit, open a pull request with and add ```in progress``` label to it. This is helpful for the QA and the other team members as it makes everyone aware of what's going on.

## End of day
* By the end of each day, every member should have made multiple commits and pushed them to github.
* If you are working on an issue, go into it and briefly report your progress in a comment.

### Once a pull request is approved and closed, document that in the body of its related issue and close it.
